                  <img src="test3.PNG" alt="test3">
                  <p>The test i do is The Big Five Personality Test
                      O = Openness,
                      C = Conscientiousness,
                      E = Extraversion,
                      A = agreeableness,
                      N = Neuroticism</p>

                  <h3> ●What do the results of these tests mean for you? </h3>
                  <p>I think these contents can provide reference for my future work, but these tests are not completely correct, I will try my best to correct my shortcomings. Anyway i will do my best.</p>

                  <h3> ●How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team? </h3>
                  <p>I pay great attention to teamwork, which I think is very important. The strength of one person is limited, but the strength of a team is much larger than that of one person. Even if there is a dispute in the team, I can solve it reasonably</p>

                  <h3> ●How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h3>
                  <p>I will assign different tasks to each of them according to their different personalities, for example, some people who are good at communication and have long-term thinking, and I will assign them to social work. Of course, all of them must be a team player</p>

                  <h3>●Overview</h3>
                  <p>I want to make a language learning app, it allows students to learn English, this app can listen to different words in English pronunciation, or teach students some commonly used sentences, still can add listening game in the app, according to hear words of choosing the right words. Of course, if you have any questions, you can also leave a message or ask professional people on the app, because the mobile phone is a product of People's Daily carry, I think in this good way can let people to learn English</p>
                  <h3>●Motivation</h3>
                  <p>English is one of the most popular language in the world now, so English learning is necessary, however, not all people can pay a lot for learning English tuition, so to launch a free English learning app is feasible, a large number of listening is the best way to learn English, so we can use the phone anytime and anywhere to hear English words and sentences, this not only saves money, makes English learning as simple, what you need is just a mobile phone.</p>

                  <p>With the development of science and technology, the performance of people's mobile phones is getting better and better, so we can do a lot of things with mobile phones. Therefore, learning on mobile phones makes people no longer need pen and paper, and gets rid of the regular way of learning. This kind of learning method becomes cooler and popular with young people.</p>
                  <h4>●Communication</h4>
                  <p>There are a lot of students who don't learn English well because they can't find professional people to solve the problems they meet.I think the best way to solve the problem is to ask, so we will add a message and comment function in the app, We will also add online chat Windows where you can communicate with others online, send messages and pictures. when you encounter any problems in English, you can leave a message on it, or start chart with other online, and professional people will answer your questions </p>
                  <h4>●Sharing</h4>
                  <p>On this app, you can share how you learn English with others,This provides more references for many English learners, and people can share some learning materials about English.</p>
                  <h4>●Improve students' interest in learning</h4>
                  <p>As mobile phones are highly entertaining, many students use them to play mobile games, listen to music and watch movies. Therefore, we will add some game elements to the English learning app, so that learning English will not become so boring, and people will not easily turn off and uninstall the app.</p>
